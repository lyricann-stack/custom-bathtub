    "Both acrylic and stone resin (also called cast stone or \"cultured stone\") make beautiful freestanding bathtubs. The marketing around them, however, is far from neutral. Several premium stone-resin brands explicitly position against acrylic in their own content to justify higher prices. That's a sales tactic — and it has quietly shaped how a lot of buyers think. Let's look at what actually differs.":"亚克力与石树脂（又称铸石或「人造石」）都能做出漂亮的独立式浴缸。然而围绕它们的营销远谈不上中立。多个高端石树脂品牌在自家内容里明确把亚克力当对照来抬高价格。那是一种销售手法——并悄悄影响了许多买家的想法。我们来看看实际差异。",
    "This is the biggest practical difference, and it rarely makes the brochure. Most \"custom\" bathtub builders online only let you change size and colour; the silhouette is fixed. Acrylic, by contrast, is the most":"这是最大的实际差异，却很少出现在宣传册上。网络上多数「定制」浴缸工具只让你改尺寸与颜色，外形是固定的。相较之下，亚克力是可塑性",
    "formable":"最强",
    "bathtub material there is — it's heat-formed over a mould, so a genuinely new curve is a question of tooling, not chemistry.":"的浴缸材料——它在模具上加热成型，所以真正全新的曲线只是开模与否的问题，而非材料化学的限制。",
    "That's why we manufacture directly from a customer's or designer's CAD file. Any curve, any dimension. Stone-resin processes can technically be moulded too, but most brands won't accept external design files at all — so in practice your shape options are whatever is already in their range.":"这就是为什么我们直接依客户或设计师的 CAD 文件制造。任意曲线、任意尺寸。石树脂工艺在技术上也能开模，但多数品牌根本不收外部设计文件——所以实际上你的外形选择就只有他们既有的那些。",
    "If a brand's \"custom tub builder\" only offers size and colour, it isn't really customisation — it's a relabelled catalogue.":"如果一个品牌的「定制浴缸工具」只给尺寸与颜色，那并不是真的定制——只是换了名字的型录。",
    "Stone resin is heavy — commonly 200–350 lb (90–160 kg) empty. That has real consequences: many brands deliver curbside only, leaving you to arrange a 3–4-person crew to move the tub inside and upstairs, and your floor structure may need checking for a second-storey install.":"石树脂很重——空缸通常 200–350 磅（90–160 公斤）。这有实际后果：许多品牌只送到路边，你得自己找 3–4 人把浴缸搬进室内、搬上楼，二楼安装时楼板结构可能还得检查。",
    "Acrylic is the lightest tub material by a wide margin. A typical freestanding acrylic tub is a comfortable two-person lift, fits standard residential floors without reinforcement, and is far simpler (and cheaper) to freight.":"亚克力是远远最轻的浴缸材料。典型的独立式亚克力浴缸两人就能轻松抬起，不需补强即可放在标准住宅楼板上，运输也简单（且便宜）得多。",
    "For a comparable size and finish, custom acrylic typically runs":"在尺寸与饰面相当的情况下，定制亚克力通常",
    "than stone resin — partly the material, partly lighter freight, partly cutting out middlemen with factory-direct production. Lower entry price also makes financing realistic: a $4,000 custom tub can sit around ~AUD $130/month with Afterpay or Zip, which removes the biggest hesitation for mid-market buyers.":"比石树脂——一部分是材料，一部分是更轻的运费，一部分是工厂直供省去中间商。较低的入手价也让分期变得实际：一个 $4,000 的定制浴缸透过 Afterpay 或 Zip，每月约 AUD $130，这消除了中端买家最大的犹豫。",
    "Acrylic has naturally low thermal conductivity, so it feels warm to the touch and holds heat well during a soak. Stone resin feels more substantial and \"solid,\" which some buyers prefer, but it can feel colder initially and is heavier to live with.":"亚克力本身导热低，摸起来温润，泡澡时也很保温。石树脂手感更厚实、「扎实」，有些买家偏好这点，但初触时偏凉，日常使用也更笨重。",
    "On durability, both wear well. The difference shows up in":"在耐用度上两者都不错。差别出现在",
    "repairs":"维修",
    ": a scratch or surface chip in acrylic can usually be polished or filled and blended; damage in stone resin is harder to fix invisibly. For a piece you'll keep for years, easy repairability matters.":"：亚克力的刮痕或表面缺角通常可以抛光或填补、融合处理；石树脂的损伤则较难修到看不出来。对一件你会用上好几年的物件，好不好修很重要。",
    "Read the returns policy before you buy anything in this category. Heavy stone-resin tubs often carry punishing terms — a short return window, customer-paid freight both ways, and a restocking fee. On a $3,000 tub, sending it back can cost the buyer $600–$900. Many of these brands also ship only within the US and Canada, with no support in Australia or New Zealand.":"在这个品类买任何东西前，先看退货政策。笨重的石树脂浴缸常有苛刻条款——退货期限短、来回运费由客户负担、还有重新上架费。一个 $3,000 的浴缸退回去，买家可能要花 $600–$900。这些品牌很多还只配送美国与加拿大，在澳洲或新西兰没有支援。",

    "This is where the gap is widest. A freestanding acrylic tub typically weighs 27–45 kg (60–100 lb), so two people can carry it up a staircase and it sits on standard floors without reinforcement. A stone-resin tub runs 90–160 kg (200–350 lb) and a copper tub can reach 160–270 kg (350–600 lb) — both often need reinforced floors, professional handling, and curbside-only freight. For upper floors, apartments and renovations, acrylic is simply easier and cheaper to live with.":"差距最大的就在这里。独立式亚克力浴缸通常重 27–45 公斤（60–100 磅），两个人就能搬上楼梯，放在标准楼板上也不必补强。石树脂浴缸约 90–160 公斤（200–350 磅），铜浴缸更可达 160–270 公斤（350–600 磅）——两者往往需要补强楼板、专业搬运，且只送到路边。对楼上、公寓与翻修而言，亚克力就是更省事也更省钱。",
    "Acrylic has very low thermal conductivity (around 0.2 W/m·K), so the surface feels warm — never icy — the moment you touch it, and it insulates the water well. Copper and stone feel cold to first touch and draw heat away from your skin. Stone resin's one genuine edge is thermal mass: on a very long soak it can hold bathwater temperature longer. For everyday baths the difference is small, and a deeper or double-skinned acrylic design closes most of the gap.":"亚克力的导热系数很低（约 0.2 W/m·K），所以一触碰表面就觉得温润、绝不冰冷，对水也保温良好。铜与石材初触偏凉，会把热量从皮肤带走。石树脂唯一真正的优势是热质量：在很长时间的泡澡中能让水温保持更久。对日常泡澡而言差异不大，而更深或双层结构的亚克力设计能补上大部分差距。",
    "Acrylic is thermoformed over a mould, making it the most shapeable bathtub material there is — almost any curve or silhouette is achievable, which is exactly why true customisation is possible. Stone resin is limited to a fixed range of cast shapes, and copper is hand-formed by artisans into a relatively narrow set of classic forms. If you want a one-of-a-kind shape designed for a specific room, acrylic is the only material that makes it practical and affordable.":"亚克力是在模具上热塑成型，因此是可塑性最强的浴缸材料——几乎任何曲线或外形都做得到，这正是能做到真正定制的原因。石树脂只限于固定范围的铸型形状，铜则由工匠手工打造成相对有限的几款经典造型。如果你想要为特定空间设计的独一无二外形，亚克力是唯一能让它既可行又负担得起的材料。",
    "Acrylic is the most affordable premium tub material, while stone resin sits at a premium and copper is the most expensive — commonly AUD $3,000 to $15,000+ before installation. Because acrylic costs less to make and ship, you get a designer look for a fraction of the price, and financing brings it within reach of the mid-market. You spend on the design, not the dead weight.":"亚克力是最实惠的高级浴缸材料，石树脂偏高价，铜则最贵——通常在安装前就要 AUD $3,000 到 $15,000 以上。由于亚克力制造与运输成本更低，你能以一小部分的价格得到设计师级的外观，分期付款更让中端市场也负担得起。你的钱花在设计上，而不是花在死重上。",
    "Acrylic's surface is smooth and non-porous, so it resists mildew, soap scum and discolouration and wipes clean easily. Light scratches can be polished out and chips repaired invisibly at low cost. Copper needs care: raw copper patinas quickly and may need periodic polishing (sealed finishes help), and stone resin, while tough, is hard to repair seamlessly if it chips. Day to day, acrylic is the lowest-maintenance of the three.":"亚克力表面光滑且无孔，因此能抵抗霉斑、皂垢与变色，擦拭即净。轻微刮痕可抛除，缺角也能以低成本修到看不出来。铜需要照顾：原色铜很快产生铜锈，可能需定期抛光（封层处理有帮助）；石树脂虽坚固，缺角后却难以无痕修复。日常使用上，亚克力是三者中最省维护的。",
    "Choose copper if you want a statement heirloom piece and budget is no object. Choose stone resin if you specifically want maximum thermal mass and a dense, monolithic feel, and your floor can take the weight. For everyone else — and especially for a custom shape, an upper-floor bathroom, easy maintenance and a sensible budget — premium acrylic is the smart choice. It's why we build exclusively in acrylic: it gives designers the most freedom and clients the best everyday experience.":"如果你想要一件彰显身份、传家级的作品而且预算无上限，选铜。如果你特别想要最大的热质量与厚重、整体的质感，而且楼板撑得住重量，选石树脂。至于其他所有人——尤其是想要定制外形、楼上浴室、好维护又预算合理的——高级亚克力才是聪明之选。这也是我们只用亚克力打造的原因：它给设计师最大的自由，也给客户最好的日常体验。",

    "Both acrylic and stone resin (also called cast stone or \"cultured stone\") make beautiful freestanding bathtubs. The marketing around them, however, is far from neutral. Several premium stone-resin brands explicitly position against acrylic in their own content to justify higher prices. That's a sales tactic — and it has quietly shaped how a lot of buyers think. Let's look at what actually differs.":"ทั้งอะคริลิกและสโตนเรซิน (หรือที่เรียกว่าหินหล่อหรือ \"หินเทียม\") ต่างก็ทำอ่างอาบน้ำตั้งพื้นที่สวยงามได้ แต่การตลาดรอบ ๆ มันกลับไม่เป็นกลาง แบรนด์สโตนเรซินพรีเมียมหลายเจ้าจงใจวางตำแหน่งต้านอะคริลิกในเนื้อหาของตนเพื่อสร้างความชอบธรรมให้ราคาที่สูงกว่า นั่นเป็นกลยุทธ์การขาย — และมันค่อย ๆ หล่อหลอมความคิดของผู้ซื้อจำนวนมาก มาดูกันว่าจริง ๆ แล้วต่างกันตรงไหน",
    "This is the biggest practical difference, and it rarely makes the brochure. Most \"custom\" bathtub builders online only let you change size and colour; the silhouette is fixed. Acrylic, by contrast, is the most":"นี่คือความแตกต่างที่สำคัญที่สุดในทางปฏิบัติ แต่แทบไม่เคยอยู่ในโบรชัวร์ ตัวช่วยออกแบบอ่าง \"สั่งทำ\" ออนไลน์ส่วนใหญ่ให้เปลี่ยนแค่ขนาดและสี รูปทรงถูกล็อกไว้ ในทางกลับกัน อะคริลิกคือวัสดุที่",
    "formable":"ขึ้นรูปได้ดีที่สุด",
    "bathtub material there is — it's heat-formed over a mould, so a genuinely new curve is a question of tooling, not chemistry.":"— มันขึ้นรูปด้วยความร้อนบนแม่พิมพ์ ดังนั้นเส้นโค้งใหม่จริง ๆ จึงเป็นเรื่องของแม่พิมพ์ ไม่ใช่เคมีของวัสดุ",
    "That's why we manufacture directly from a customer's or designer's CAD file. Any curve, any dimension. Stone-resin processes can technically be moulded too, but most brands won't accept external design files at all — so in practice your shape options are whatever is already in their range.":"นั่นคือเหตุผลที่เราผลิตจากไฟล์ CAD ของลูกค้าหรือนักออกแบบโดยตรง ทุกเส้นโค้ง ทุกขนาด กระบวนการสโตนเรซินก็หล่อแม่พิมพ์ได้ในทางเทคนิค แต่แบรนด์ส่วนใหญ่ไม่รับไฟล์ออกแบบภายนอกเลย — ในทางปฏิบัติตัวเลือกรูปทรงของคุณจึงมีแค่ที่มีอยู่แล้วในไลน์ของพวกเขา",
    "If a brand's \"custom tub builder\" only offers size and colour, it isn't really customisation — it's a relabelled catalogue.":"ถ้า \"ตัวช่วยออกแบบอ่าง\" ของแบรนด์ให้แค่ขนาดและสี นั่นไม่ใช่การสั่งทำจริง — แต่เป็นแคตตาล็อกที่เปลี่ยนชื่อ",
    "Stone resin is heavy — commonly 200–350 lb (90–160 kg) empty. That has real consequences: many brands deliver curbside only, leaving you to arrange a 3–4-person crew to move the tub inside and upstairs, and your floor structure may need checking for a second-storey install.":"สโตนเรซินหนัก — โดยทั่วไป 200–350 ปอนด์ (90–160 กก.) ตอนเปล่า นั่นมีผลจริง: หลายแบรนด์ส่งถึงหน้าบ้านเท่านั้น คุณต้องจัดหาคน 3–4 คนยกอ่างเข้าบ้านและขึ้นชั้นบน และโครงสร้างพื้นอาจต้องตรวจสอบสำหรับการติดตั้งชั้นสอง",
    "Acrylic is the lightest tub material by a wide margin. A typical freestanding acrylic tub is a comfortable two-person lift, fits standard residential floors without reinforcement, and is far simpler (and cheaper) to freight.":"อะคริลิกเป็นวัสดุอ่างที่เบาที่สุดอย่างชัดเจน อ่างอะคริลิกตั้งพื้นทั่วไปสองคนยกสบาย รองรับพื้นที่อยู่อาศัยมาตรฐานโดยไม่ต้องเสริม และขนส่งง่าย (และถูก) กว่ามาก",
    "For a comparable size and finish, custom acrylic typically runs":"สำหรับขนาดและพื้นผิวที่ใกล้เคียงกัน อะคริลิกสั่งทำมักจะ",
    "than stone resin — partly the material, partly lighter freight, partly cutting out middlemen with factory-direct production. Lower entry price also makes financing realistic: a $4,000 custom tub can sit around ~AUD $130/month with Afterpay or Zip, which removes the biggest hesitation for mid-market buyers.":"กว่าสโตนเรซิน — ส่วนหนึ่งเพราะวัสดุ ส่วนหนึ่งเพราะค่าขนส่งที่เบากว่า ส่วนหนึ่งเพราะตัดคนกลางด้วยการผลิตส่งตรงจากโรงงาน ราคาเริ่มต้นที่ต่ำกว่ายังทำให้การผ่อนเป็นจริงได้: อ่างสั่งทำ $4,000 อยู่ที่ราว ~AUD $130/เดือน ด้วย Afterpay หรือ Zip ซึ่งขจัดความลังเลที่ใหญ่ที่สุดของผู้ซื้อตลาดกลาง",
    "Acrylic has naturally low thermal conductivity, so it feels warm to the touch and holds heat well during a soak. Stone resin feels more substantial and \"solid,\" which some buyers prefer, but it can feel colder initially and is heavier to live with.":"อะคริลิกนำความร้อนต่ำโดยธรรมชาติ จึงสัมผัสอุ่นและเก็บความร้อนได้ดีระหว่างแช่ สโตนเรซินให้สัมผัสที่หนักแน่นและ \"ตัน\" กว่า ซึ่งผู้ซื้อบางคนชอบ แต่ตอนแรกอาจรู้สึกเย็นกว่าและหนักกว่าในการใช้ชีวิตประจำวัน",
    "On durability, both wear well. The difference shows up in":"ด้านความทนทาน ทั้งคู่ทนดี ความต่างปรากฏที่",
    "repairs":"การซ่อม",
    ": a scratch or surface chip in acrylic can usually be polished or filled and blended; damage in stone resin is harder to fix invisibly.

    "Read the returns policy before you buy anything in this category. Heavy stone-resin tubs often carry punishing terms — a short return window, customer-paid freight both ways, and a restocking fee. On a $3,000 tub, sending it back can cost the buyer $600–$900. Many of these brands also ship only within the US and Canada, with no support in Australia or New Zealand.":"อ่านนโยบายการคืนก่อนซื้ออะไรในหมวดนี้ อ่างสโตนเรซินที่หนักมักมีเงื่อนไขที่โหด — ระยะเวลาคืนสั้น ลูกค้าจ่ายค่าขนส่งทั้งสองทาง และค่าวางสต็อกใหม่ อ่าง $3,000 ส่งคืนอาจทำให้ผู้ซื้อเสีย $600–$900 แบรนด์เหล่านี้หลายเจ้ายังส่งเฉพาะในสหรัฐฯ และแคนาดา โดยไม่มีบริการในออสเตรเลียหรือนิวซีแลนด์",
    "Our approach is different by design: because every tub is bespoke, we sign off a design specification with you":"แนวทางของเราต่างโดยตั้งใจ: เพราะทุกอ่างเป็นงานสั่งทำ เราจึงยืนยันและลงนามข้อกำหนดการออกแบบร่วมกับคุณ",

    "This is where the gap is widest. A freestanding acrylic tub typically weighs 27–45 kg (60–100 lb), so two people can carry it up a staircase and it sits on standard floors without reinforcement. A stone-resin tub runs 90–160 kg (200–350 lb) and a copper tub can reach 160–270 kg (350–600 lb) — both often need reinforced floors, professional handling, and curbside-only freight. For upper floors, apartments and renovations, acrylic is simply easier and cheaper to live with.":"นี่คือจุดที่ต่างกันมากที่สุด อ่างอะคริลิกตั้งพื้นทั่วไปหนัก 27–45 กก. (60–100 ปอนด์) สองคนยกขึ้นบันไดได้ และวางบนพื้นมาตรฐานได้โดยไม่ต้องเสริมโครงสร้าง อ่างสโตนเรซินหนัก 90–160 กก. (200–350 ปอนด์) และอ่างทองแดงอาจถึง 160–270 กก. (350–600 ปอนด์) — ทั้งคู่มักต้องเสริมพื้น ใช้ทีมขนมืออาชีพ และส่งถึงหน้าบ้านเท่านั้น สำหรับชั้นบน คอนโด และงานรีโนเวต อะคริลิกง่ายและประหยัดกว่าชัดเจน",
    "Acrylic has very low thermal conductivity (around 0.2 W/m·K), so the surface feels warm — never icy — the moment you touch it, and it insulates the water well. Copper and stone feel cold to first touch and draw heat away from your skin. Stone resin's one genuine edge is thermal mass: on a very long soak it can hold bathwater temperature longer. For everyday baths the difference is small, and a deeper or double-skinned acrylic design closes most of the gap.":"อะคริลิกนำความร้อนต่ำมาก (ราว 0.2 W/m·K) พื้นผิวจึงสัมผัสอุ่น — ไม่เย็นเฉียบ — ตั้งแต่แตะ และเป็นฉนวนให้น้ำได้ดี ทองแดงและหินสัมผัสแรกเย็นและดึงความร้อนออกจากผิว ข้อได้เปรียบจริงข้อเดียวของสโตนเรซินคือมวลความร้อน: ในการแช่ที่นานมากมันเก็บอุณหภูมิน้ำได้นานกว่า สำหรับการอาบน้ำทั่วไปความต่างเล็กน้อย และดีไซน์อะคริลิกที่ลึกกว่าหรือผนังสองชั้นช่วยปิดช่องว่างได้เกือบหมด",
    "Acrylic is thermoformed over a mould, making it the most shapeable bathtub material there is — almost any curve or silhouette is achievable, which is exactly why true customisation is possible. Stone resin is limited to a fixed range of cast shapes, and copper is hand-formed by artisans into a relatively narrow set of classic forms. If you want a one-of-a-kind shape designed for a specific room, acrylic is the only material that makes it practical and affordable.":"อะคริลิกขึ้นรูปด้วยความร้อนบนแม่พิมพ์ จึงเป็นวัสดุอ่างที่ขึ้นรูปได้ดีที่สุด — แทบทุกเส้นโค้งหรือรูปทรงทำได้ ซึ่งเป็นเหตุผลที่การสั่งทำจริงเป็นไปได้ สโตนเรซินจำกัดอยู่ที่รูปทรงหล่อตายตัว ส่วนทองแดงขึ้นรูปด้วยมือช่างเป็นทรงคลาสสิกไม่กี่แบบ หากคุณต้องการรูปทรงหนึ่งเดียวที่ออกแบบเพื่อห้องเฉพาะ อะคริลิกเป็นวัสดุเดียวที่ทำให้เป็นจริงได้และจ่ายไหว",
    "Acrylic is the most affordable premium tub material, while stone resin sits at a premium and copper is the most expensive — commonly AUD $3,000 to $15,000+ before installation. Because acrylic costs less to make and ship, you get a designer look for a fraction of the price, and financing brings it within reach of the mid-market. You spend on the design, not the dead weight.":"อะคริลิกเป็นวัสดุอ่างพรีเมียมที่คุ้มค่าที่สุด ขณะที่สโตนเรซินราคาสูงและทองแดงแพงที่สุด — โดยทั่วไป AUD $3,000 ถึง $15,000 ขึ้นไปก่อนติดตั้ง เพราะอะคริลิกผลิตและขนส่งถูกกว่า คุณจึงได้ลุคระดับดีไซเนอร์ในราคาเพียงเศษเสี้ยว และการผ่อนทำให้ตลาดกลางเอื้อมถึง คุณจ่ายไปกับการออกแบบ ไม่ใช่กับน้ำหนักที่ไร้ประโยชน์",
    "Acrylic's surface is smooth and non-porous, so it resists mildew, soap scum and discolouration and wipes clean easily. Light scratches can be polished out and chips repaired invisibly at low cost. Copper needs care: raw copper patinas quickly and may need periodic polishing (sealed finishes help), and stone resin, while tough, is hard to repair seamlessly if it chips. Day to day, acrylic is the lowest-maintenance of the three.":"พื้นผิวอะคริลิกเรียบและไม่มีรูพรุน จึงต้านเชื้อรา คราบสบู่ และการเปลี่ยนสี เช็ดทำความสะอาดง่าย รอยขีดข่วนเล็กน้อยขัดออกได้ และรอยบิ่นซ่อมให้มองไม่เห็นได้ในราคาต่ำ ทองแดงต้องดูแล: ทองแดงดิบเกิดคราบเร็วและอาจต้องขัดเงาเป็นระยะ (ผิวเคลือบช่วยได้) ส่วนสโตนเรซินแม้แข็งแรงแต่ซ่อมให้เนียนยากเมื่อบิ่น ในชีวิตประจำวัน อะคริลิกดูแลง่ายที่สุดในสามอย่าง",
    "Choose copper if you want a statement heirloom piece and budget is no object. Choose stone resin if you specifically want maximum thermal mass and a dense, monolithic feel, and your floor can take the weight. For everyone else — and especially for a custom shape, an upper-floor bathroom, easy maintenance and a sensible budget — premium acrylic is the smart choice. It's why we build exclusively in acrylic: it gives designers the most freedom and clients the best everyday experience.":"เลือกทองแดงถ้าคุณต้องการชิ้นงานตกทอดที่โดดเด่นและไม่จำกัดงบ เลือกสโตนเรซินถ้าคุณต้องการมวลความร้อนสูงสุดและสัมผัสที่หนักแน่นเป็นเนื้อเดียว และพื้นรับน้ำหนักไหว สำหรับคนอื่น ๆ ทั้งหมด — โดยเฉพาะรูปทรงสั่งทำ ห้องน้ำชั้นบน การดูแลที่ง่าย และงบที่สมเหตุผล — อะคริลิกพรีเมียมคือทางเลือกที่ฉลาด นี่คือเหตุผลที่เราผลิตด้วยอะคริลิกเท่านั้น: มันให้อิสระแก่ดีไซเนอร์มากที่สุด และให้ลูกค้าได้ประสบการณ์ประจำวันที่ดีที่สุด",
